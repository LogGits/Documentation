## Quick Note

Hi Guys, the developer, Dinosaurs, here. The system may seem like a hefty
task to learn, however it is quite simple! Once learned, it is easy to
master. To be honest, you don't even need to master it... copy-paste!
Just copy-paste the lines and easily edit from there!

## Explain the Chances
The chance system is quite different from other systems. However, it
allows an unlimited customizibility and it is quite simple to learn.

### The Basics
Basically, you want to start with a base number (`100`), and building
from that, we can create a chance system. Numbers higher than `100` will
be common, while numbers lower than `100` will be rarer. Think the larger
the number, the large the chance it will have, Vice-versa.

### Examples
```

 - 'item:(apple 1),chance:(1)'




## Item Parsing
 - 'cmd:(/give %player% cake 1),chance:(4)'```
_ = Space
/n = New Line
%line% = New Line
; = Seperate Enchantments
```
### Example
```
diamond_sword 1 &1Sword_1 Legendary_Sword 35:5;34:5
dirt 1 &Just_plain_old_dirt dirt 33:5;34:5
```
