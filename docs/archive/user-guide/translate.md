# The Languages
CrateReloaded currently supports two languages.
To simply change the language to one of those, change the `config.yml`.

## Currently Supported Languages

### English
Code: `en`

### French
Code: `fr`

# How to modify the language file.
CrateReloaded provides language files to allow you to edit and change it
to your own language.

## Starting Off
1. Find CrateReloaded's locale folder inside `/plugin/CrateReloaded/`
2. Look for the `lang` folder which holds all the language files.
3. Go onto "Modify" or "Create a new language file"
